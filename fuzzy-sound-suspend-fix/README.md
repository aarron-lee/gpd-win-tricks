# Fuzzy sound after suspend fix

Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1eh99as/distorted_audio_after_waking_up_your_steam_deck/

This fix reportedly fixes distorted audio after waking up the steam deck.

It might help on other devices too

# For SteamOS users

Make sure to set up your user password (skip this step if you already have it):

1. Open terminal of your choice (Konsole is the default one on SteamOS)
- Note that the letters won't be visible while entering password, this is normal
- DO NOT FORGET YOUR PASSWORD, IT'S NOT EASY TO RECOVER.
- This password is separate from your steam password, this is a password for your local device account.
2. Inside the terminal, type passwd and create your new user password

# Install

Make sure you have a sudo password set, you'll need it for the install/uninstall process

Run in terminal:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/aarron-lee/gpd-win-tricks/raw/main/fuzzy-sound-suspend-fix/install.sh | sudo sh
```

# Uninstall

Run in terminal

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/aarron-lee/gpd-win-tricks/raw/main/fuzzy-sound-suspend-fix/uninstall.sh | sudo sh
```
